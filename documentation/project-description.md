# Hexatope

Hexatope is a design system based on a hexagonal grid. With a simple interface and intuitive set of rules it enables users to design beautiful, complex and unique forms without prior experience. Using touch or mouse input, users draw undulating curves which diverge and overlap one another with seemingly organic grace.

Hexatope is a facilitator of co-creation; it encourages users to discover how it works by interacting with it. In parallel to their exploration of it as a tool, they develop their own artistic style within the aesthetic framework of the grid and its ruleset.

Algorithms determine how the curves interact in 3D space, creating objects where tactility and tangibility are paramount. In this exhibition the Hexatope system manifests as pieces of jewellery; the preciosity of the pieces highlights both the elegance of the system and the importance of the designerâ€™s intentions.

With the aid of interactive technology Hexatope aims to spark creativity in its users, they have the potential not only to be designers, but to be creators of beautiful and personal physical objects regardless of their aptitude for design.

The Hexatope system is built using JavaScript and web technologies, with WebGL to render a preview of the model. The pieces are exported as 3D objects and printed with castable liquid resin, then using the lost-wax method the 3D-printed pieces are cast into sterling silver and finished and polished by hand.
