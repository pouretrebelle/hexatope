We like [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for dependency management, installation instructions can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- `yarn start` - run in development mode
- `yarn run build` - build site
- `yarn run lint` - checks you're not writing shit code
- `yarn run clean` - clean out dist folder
