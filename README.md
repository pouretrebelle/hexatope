[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/pouretrebelle/hexatope.svg?style=shield&circle-token=0268eaecef5769dc4a1a8a515104ae2dce416a6b)](https://circleci.com/gh/pouretrebelle/hexatope)

## :raised_hands: Make it work locally

We like [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for dependency management, installation instructions can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- `yarn start` - run in development mode on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- `yarn run build` - build site
- `yarn run lint` - checks you're not writing shit code

## :rocket: Deploy it

For the mo the site is deployed to [hexatope.io](http://hexatope.io/) using Github Pages from the `docs` folder. The static pages are manually added from [this Codepen project](https://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/project/editor/430989965c709ba691a4210f655ea7d5), and the app can be updated by running `yarn run build` and then committing with a `:rocket:` commit message.
